Reimplementation in Ruby of `t` (https://github.com/sjl/t)

I thought `t` was neat. I thought it would be fun to do this. It was.

(Still broken in places atm.)
(Might add more features for fun.)

Installation:
Change shebang to point to your ruby.
Run bundle or manually install 'slop' and 'pp'
Consider creating an alias along the lines of `alias t='~/projects/rt/rt.rb --task-dir ~'`

Requires ruby >= 2.6.3.
